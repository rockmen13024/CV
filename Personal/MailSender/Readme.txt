This project was made to send custom emails to a list of recivers, with custom attachements, using a gmail account as sender.

I wrote it in python and ran it on my raspberry pi, but it should work ona any linux machine.

It depends on yagmail library. 

The code sends a custom email to each person from the "recivers" list, with custom attachements. Since there is no GUI, the body of 
the mail must be wrote in html code.
